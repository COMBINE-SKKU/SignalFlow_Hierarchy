## Content

This directory contains subdirectories with all the codes necessary to generate the results and plots for Figure 2.

For example, if you want to replicate the plots for the simulation analysis:

1. Navigate to the figure2-1(simulation) directory.
2. Run the scripts in sequential order.

All intermediary data are stored, allowing you to visualize results at any stage. If you're only interested in visualizing the final results:

1. Open the visualization script (e.g., sim_04_data_visualization.m).
2. Run the entire script to generate the plots.

This structure allows for flexible replication and analysis of the Figure 2 results, whether you want to run the entire process or focus on specific aspects of the data visualization.
